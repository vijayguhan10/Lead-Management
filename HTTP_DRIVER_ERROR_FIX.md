# NestJS HTTP Driver Error Fix

## Problem Statement

The following error was occurring when starting NestJS microservices:

```
@ [3] [Nest] 38564  - 24/08/2025, 10:18:22 am   ERROR [PackageLoader] No driver (HTTP) has been selected. In order to take advantage of the default driver, please, ensure to install the "@nestjs/platform-express" package ($ npm install @nestjs/platform-express).
```

## Root Cause

The error was caused by **version mismatches** between NestJS core packages across the microservices. Some services were using:
- `@nestjs/common`: `^11.0.1`
- `@nestjs/core`: `^11.0.1` 
- `@nestjs/platform-express`: `^11.0.1`

While others were using:
- `@nestjs/common`: `^11.1.5`
- `@nestjs/core`: `^11.1.5`
- `@nestjs/platform-express`: `^11.1.5`

This version inconsistency caused NestJS to fail to properly detect and load the HTTP platform driver.

## Solution

1. **Standardized NestJS versions** across all microservices to use the latest stable versions:
   - `@nestjs/common`: `^11.1.5`
   - `@nestjs/core`: `^11.1.5` 
   - `@nestjs/platform-express`: `^11.1.5`
   - `@nestjs/testing`: `^11.1.5`

2. **Updated the following services**:
   - auth-service
   - user-service
   - call-service
   - notification-service
   - media-service
   - (Telecaller-service and lead-service already had correct versions)

3. **Reinstalled dependencies** for all services to ensure clean installations with consistent versions.

## Services Fixed

All microservices now start successfully without the HTTP driver error:

- ✅ auth-service
- ✅ user-service  
- ✅ lead-service
- ✅ call-service
- ✅ notification-service
- ✅ media-service
- ✅ Telecaller-service

## Verification

A test script (`test-services.sh`) has been added to verify all services start without HTTP driver errors. Run it with:

```bash
./test-services.sh
```

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. Keep NestJS package versions consistent across all microservices
2. Use exact version ranges when possible for core NestJS packages
3. Test all services after any dependency updates
4. Use the provided test script to verify service startup

## Technical Details

The HTTP driver error occurs when:
- NestJS core packages have version mismatches
- The `@nestjs/platform-express` package is not properly detected
- There are conflicting dependencies in the dependency tree

This is a common issue in microservice architectures where different services may have different dependency versions installed over time.
